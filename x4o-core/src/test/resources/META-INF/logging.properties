# unit test logging setup.

# Specify the handlers to create in the root logger
# (all loggers are children of the root logger)
# The following creates two handlers
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# Set the default logging level for new ConsoleHandler instances
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = ALL
 
# Set the default logging level for the root logger
.level = INFO

org.x4o.parser = ALL

# Java 6 has internal logging on many builtin libs
