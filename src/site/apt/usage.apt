Usage
  
  X4O had multiple modules the one which is most used is x4o-driver which implements the full x4o framework.
  
* X4O maven modules
  
  * x4o = project base.
  
  * x4o-driver = Main x4o library.
  
  * x4o-elddoc = X4O Eld documentation support.
  
  * x4o-meta = X4O Meta sibling language.
  
  * x4o-plugin = X4O external plugins.
  
  * x4o-plugin-ant = X4O Ant plugins for schema and documentation task.
  
  * x4o-plugin-maven = X4O Maven plugin task.
  

* Setup as library

  Append the core maven dependency;
  
+--
   <dependency>
     <groupId>org.x4o</groupId>
     <artifactId>x4o-driver</artifactId>
     <version>0.8.6-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>
+--

  Note: currently x4o is not in main maven repro, so build and install local yourself.

* Setup build task

  Append the x4o ant tasks;

+--
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.x4o.plugin</groupId>
    <artifactId>x4o-plugin-ant</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
  </dependency>
+--

  Use in ant and set the supportclass from the language you want to run the task for.
