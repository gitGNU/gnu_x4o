=== Welcome in X4O ===
  
X4O is a java package for parsing your own xml language over unmodified POJO objects.
The xml element config is defined in a recursive x4o language and so can be extended.

The extension modules are dynamically loaded from the classpath to define new namespaces.
Besides the elements in the namespace, modules also define the object parent child relation
binding interfaces which results in an object tree. 

This all can be used to create your own powerful xml parser and (re)define your own xml
language, with using little code and also getting automatic schema generation.
